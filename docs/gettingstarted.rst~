How it works
============

|Prometheus| uses stars to derive an analytical point spread function (PSF) for an image.  It then fits the height and central coordinates of all stars *simultaneously* using the PSF.


The CCDData Object
==================

This is the object type used for images and is based on the astropy CCDData type but has some additional capabilities that are needed for |Prometheus|.

.. code-block:: python

        from prometheus.ccdata import CCDData
	image = CCDData(flux,error,mask=mask)

You can also read an image directly from a file.
	
.. code-block:: python

        from prometheus.ccdata import CCDData
	image = CCDData.read('ccd1100.fits')

You can also write a CCDData object to file.  This saves the flux, error, mask and sky (computed) to file.
	
.. code-block:: python

	image.write('outfile.fits')
        

The PSF Object
==============



read()

write()
